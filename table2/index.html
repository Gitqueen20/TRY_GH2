              <h1>What is Lorem?</h1>
              <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. <br>
                Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute <br> irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
                Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat <br> non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>

              <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
              <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br>
                The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <br> 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
                Many desktop publishing packages and web page <br> editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <br>
                Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

              <h1>Where does it come from?</h1>
              <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, 
                a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the <br> more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, <br> discovered the undoubtable source. 
                Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" <br> (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
                This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br> during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
              <h1>Where can I get some?</h1>
              <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected <br> humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. 
                If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need <br> to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. 
                All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend <br> to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. 
                It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, <br> combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum <br> is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
